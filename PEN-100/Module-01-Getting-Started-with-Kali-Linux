Module-01: Getting Started with Kali Linux
📖 Module Overview:
In Module-01, I was introduced to Kali Linux, a powerful Debian-based Linux distribution used for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and security auditing.
This module focused on installing Kali Linux, configuring the environment, and understanding basic Linux commands that are essential for daily operations in security assessments.

🎯 Learning Objectives:
Understand the purpose of Kali Linux in cybersecurity.

Explore different installation methods (VM, Bare Metal, WSL, Live USB).

Configure the Kali Linux environment for security tasks.

Learn basic Linux commands and navigation.

Update and manage Kali Linux with package management tools.

🛠️ Practical Work Completed:
1. Kali Linux Installation:
Platform Chosen: Virtual Machine (using VirtualBox)

Configuration:

Allocated 4 GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and 20 GB disk space.

Installed Kali Linux ISO.

Non-root user creation during installation for better security practice.

2. Initial System Update:
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Result: All installed packages and Kali Linux tools were updated to their latest versions.

3. Exploring the Kali Linux Environment:
Navigated through the XFCE Desktop environment for better user experience.

Discovered and launched Kali’s pre-installed tools from the Applications Menu (including nmap, metasploit, burp suite, etc.).

Familiarized with the Kali Tools menu for penetration testing and security assessments.

4. Practicing Basic Linux Commands:
Learned essential commands for system navigation and file manipulation:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Check the current user
whoami

# List files and directories
ls

# Change directory
cd <directory>

# Print working directory
pwd

# Create a directory
mkdir <directory-name>

# Remove a file or directory
rm <filename>
5. Package Management with APT:
Updated system and installed basic tools using apt:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Update system package list
sudo apt update

# Install a new package (e.g., nmap)
sudo apt install nmap

# Remove an unused package
sudo apt remove <package-name>
