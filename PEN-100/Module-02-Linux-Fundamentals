## Module-02: Linux Fundamentals

---

### 📖 Module Overview:
In **Module-02**, I learned the **Linux fundamentals** which are essential for working efficiently with **Linux-based operating systems** like **Kali Linux**. The focus of this module was to understand how to navigate the **Linux file system**, manage users, set file permissions, handle processes, and use basic text editors. These skills are critical for penetration testing and security assessments.

---

### 🎯 Learning Objectives:
- Understand the **Linux file system** and its structure.
- Learn to navigate and manipulate **files and directories**.
- Understand **user management** and **group management** in Linux.
- Learn how to work with **file permissions** and **process management**.
- Get familiar with the **apt package management system**.
- Learn how to use **text editors** like **Vim** and **Nano**.

---

### 🛠️ Practical Work Completed:

#### 1. **Linux File System Structure**:
- Explored the basic Linux directories:
  - `/`, `/home`, `/bin`, `/etc`, `/var`, etc.
  - Learned their purpose in the Linux ecosystem.
  
#### 2. **Working with Files and Directories**:
- Navigated directories and created files and directories:
```bash
mkdir test_directory
touch test_file.txt
List files with permissions and ownership:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -l
Copied, moved, and removed files:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp test_file.txt test_copy.txt
mv test_copy.txt test_directory/
rm test_directory/test_copy.txt

#### 3. User and Group Management:
Created a new user and assigned a password:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo useradd test_user
sudo passwd test_user
Created a new group and added the user to the group:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo groupadd test_group
sudo usermod -aG test_group test_user

#### 4. File Permissions:
Changed file permissions and ownership:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 755 test_file.txt
chown test_user:test_group test_file.txt
Explained file permissions:

r (Read), w (Write), x (Execute).

#### 5. Process Management:
View running processes:

bash
Copy
Edit
ps aux
top
Killed a process using PID:

bash
Copy
Edit
kill 1234  # 1234 is the PID

#### 6. Package Management:
Installed and updated a package using APT:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
Upgraded the system:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt upgrade

#### 7. Text Editors:
Opened and edited files using Nano and Vim:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano test_file.txt
vim test_file.txt
